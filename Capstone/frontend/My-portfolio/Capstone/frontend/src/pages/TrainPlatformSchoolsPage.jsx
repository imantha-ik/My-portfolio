              There are millions of children working throughout India, earning money for their families or
              living on the street and trains trying to support themselves.
              <br /><br />
              Sometimes, they work for 12 hours a day, collecting plastics to sell, sweeping the train, or
              selling food to passengers.

              Train Platform Schools are located on, underneath or nearby train station platforms throughout
              Bhubaneswar in the state of Orissa in India. The Train Platform Schools were created and are operated by staff of the <strong>Ruchika Social Services Organisation</strong>.
              <br /><br />
              The school staff invite children working on the trains, at the train stations and also local children to join in fun games, singing and dancing. This then leads to also providing basic literacy and maths tuition, healthcare, food and counselling.

              Through receiving a basic education children have a greater chance of escaping the cycle of
              intergenerational poverty.
              <br /><br />
              The Train Platform Schools provide this opportunity for children who may otherwise not have access
              to an education.
